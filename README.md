# Snake Game

This is a Retro Snake Game inspired by the iconic Nokia Snake game using vanilla HMTL, CSS and JavaScript!

Using JS we will draw the game board, create the snake and randomly generated food, make the snake move, increase the snake size when it eats, and increase its speed. we will also keep the score, track collisions for the snake, and display the high score which is stored locally.
